                <p class="WAH">H.O.M.E. (Homeless Obliteration Mega Establishment) is a charity focused on giving the homeless homes. We use the funding we receive to pay for the homeless to have housing until they are able to get back on their own feet. Once they are at a stable point we will monitor until they are comfortable enough to be on their own. If said person is unable to work we will provide housing nonetheless.</p>
